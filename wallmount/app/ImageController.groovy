 * This class handles server side image scaling operations.
 * 
 * Usage of server side scaling is done to remove
 * image operations away from browser dom rendering tree. If dom
 * tree contains components with animation it results redraw
 * through the whole rendering tree. If browser scales the image
 * itselves, it's most of the time rescaled over and over again.
 * 
 * To have a already scaled image will
 * radically boost performance in cases where multiple images and
 * sizes are used.
 * 
 * Image which is scaled on server has to exist on plugin's public
 * material. All PNG images under path /hqu/wmvisualizer/public/...
